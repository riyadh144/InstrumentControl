# InstrumentControl

## Note
I am seperrating the different classes into folders for ease of use but you need to have all the classes that you plan to use in the same directory
create a main file to run the script from
import the different modules

## Dependencies
Depending on how you want to install the dependencies, you can either use pip from the command line or use the method in your favorite IDE
for example in pycharm use the following guide
